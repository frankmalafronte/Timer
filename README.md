Welcome To Stack Timer

This is a time management and tracking application that I built in four days during Fullstack Academy's Hackatahon. The goal of the project was to attempt to hack something together in a short amount of time, and to use a new API or library that I had not used before.

In my case, I used the Google Charts Api and a library called react google charts to render tabels and charts based on data coming from a database.

You can use Stack Timer to track your coding activities, then save their length of time, plus a category(coding, sleeping, and procrastinating only in this case) and a description that will be saved to your database. Then you can look back on each length of time on the Table page, and see a breakdown of how much time you spent on each category.

If cloned from this repo, you must run npm i react-google-charts, then run npm run start-dev to deploy to your local host. If can also be viewed at stacktimer.herokuapp.com
